### Selected Paper:

***Lbl2Vec: An Embedding-Based Approach for Unsupervised Document Retrieval on Predefined Topics*** - Accessible from: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06023

### Folder Structure:

* The data used in this project can be found compressed in **ag_news_data.zip**. This folder contains three files:
    * train.csv - the data used for training of all algorithms in the notebook
    * test.csv - the data used for testing of all algorithms in the notebook
    * labels.csv - the keywords used to describe distinct topics - used for the selected algorithm

 ### Additional Resources:

 * Due to the size of the file, the pre-trained Glove vector representations could not be attached to the repo, but available for download at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/watts2/glove6b50dtxt
